Barrie Cooke

Barrie Cooke (born 1931) is an Irish abstract expressionist painter. He was born in Cheshire, England. He has lived and worked in Ireland since 1954. Though he has been based in Ireland ever since, he is widely traveled and his richly expressionist, semi-abstract paintings have been strongly influenced by time spent in such far-flung places as Lapland, New Zealand, Borneo and Malaya.

He was commissioned by Penguin Books to write a travel book. He went to Bermuda and the Red Sea, and wrote and illustrated Blue Angels and Whales (1938). This was the first original writing commissioned by Penguin. The book led to Gibbings’s appointment as art director of a new series of Penguin Illustrated Classics.

In August 1945 he set out for Polynesia again. He visited many of the islands and spent some time in New Zealand.
Sir John Lavery

He then traveled as far as Peking, China with George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney as the expedition's official portrait painter.

By 1798 he had returned to India where he landed just in time for the start of the Fourth Mysore War, which kept him engaged in painting. He resided in Madras until his death in 1824.
